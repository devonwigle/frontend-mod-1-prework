## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  1. I like to be perfectly on target, realizing that there is always room to grow helps me to realistically look at events or projects in which perfection is not attainable.  If perfection is not attainable but you learn something from the process, than you have gotten as close to perfection in that moment as you can.
  2. Reflection is important to the coding process as this allows you to expand, refine, and reevaluate.  I need to hear this because I typically am done with a project when I say I am done. Not much reflection.
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  * I think a demonstrate a growth mindset by understanding that mistakes are key to learning, and that practice makes you better, I seek challenges that are a bit beyond me but not completely out of reach.
  * I can have a better growth mindset by understanding when I need to seek assistance instead of soldiering through.
1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Spotify would probably use an array to keep track of liked tracks. You can then view your "Liked Songs".  It seems a simple way to show a list of songs that you have liked.
1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method is a function that is preprogrammed into JavaScript, so I don't have to write the function every time.  Some examples would be: `reverse` and `length`
1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
A loop allows a program to iterate over a set of items without having to write code for each iteration. We would use a loop with an array if we are looking to do something to each index position. We would use a loop without an array if we need to do something a specific number of times.
1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
So if you want to color your picture using the pink, blue, and red crayon. What do you do first? Choose an area you want to color. Next you would choose which color crayon you wanted to color with. Then you would use that crayon to color your chosen area. When you were done coloring with that crayon you would put it down and start the process again.
1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
When you use `pop` on an array, does it permanently delete the last index, or does it move somewhere outside of the array?

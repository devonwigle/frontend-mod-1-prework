## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
My workflow usually felt interrupted and broken.  This made me feel stressed since I shove work in where I can fit it. There was a couple times when I was fixating on a problem that it helped me reset, but largely felt unhelpful.
1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
It was hit or miss. The first time I finished the work I had set out to do and then two more sections.  The next one task took several breaks to get through.
1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An object contains different key-value pairs that all describe one real-life item. An array is a list that can contain an type of data type, that don't necessarily relate to each other.
1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  An array, since you are just listing names of the students and not individual attributes of the students.
  * List of states and their capitals
  Object would be better as the state and capital can be directly linked together in an object
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  An array, since it is just a list
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  An array, since it is a simple list.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  An object, since you have multiple students and cohorts to be related to each other
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  An object, since you have multiple ingredients and amounts to relate to each other.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  An array, since it is just a list.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
Maps would have a route object. It might contain keys for avoidsTolls, avoidsHighways, avoidsFerries, distanceMeasurement, distanceFromAToB.  Values would be `true`, `false`, `true`, `"miles"`, `1402`.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
I don't have many questions off the top of my head.  I still find myself getting vocabulary confused, which leads to syntax errors.  So that is something to practice.

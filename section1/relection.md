## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The SuperLearner article made me feel pretty good, since I already do most of the items on the list. I already read often, acknowledge that learning is a process, have a growth mindset, pass on my knowledge, and generally eat healthy. I can definitely take more breaks.  I may add enjoyment.  I find that if you enjoy learning it is much easier to learn.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

 * Numbers are any data of numerical value not encased in '' or "".
 * String are data that can consist of alphanumerical characters and other characters as long as they are encased in '' or "".
 * Boolean are data that return true or false. It is or it is not.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
```JavaScript
console.log("Hello World!");
```
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
There are several ways to indicate comments in JavaScript. There is:
```JavaScript
// single line comments
/* a
  multi-line
  comment*/
  ```
The purpose of the code comment is to explain something in the code or to gray-out a piece of code that should not be run yet.
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable, as explained to my 5 year old:
A variable is a thing that holds a piece of information for you so that you can use it more easily later.
For example, I can store the number of how many kids are in your kindergarten class, then if someone asks me, I can tell them 16 students instead of counting all of them again.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
Three variables used would probably be:
 * mainIngredient
 * numberBeefRecipes
 * course

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is putting together variables using +.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
I think the developers would use concatenation to tell me how many recipes are in the course selection that have the main ingredient that was selected.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
Is the semicolon at the end of each line of code have a purpose besides denoting the end of the line?
